Based on your historical posture scores, I can see that your back and shoulders have improved significantly, with your neck straightening out as well. Excellent work! However, I still see room for improvement. Though you have come a long way, your back and shoulders could still be more aligned and your neck could still use some straightening. I recommend incorporating stretching and strengthening exercises to your daily routine to help mitigate any aches or pains, and pay particular attention to sitting and standing with your back straight. Remember, a healthy spine is the cornerstone of good posture. Keep up the good work!
