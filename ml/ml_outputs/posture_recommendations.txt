Hello there! After reviewing your posture scores, it seems that overall you tend to hold your back in a slightly crooked position. This can be a result of spending long hours sitting at a desk or by not taking frequent breaks to stretch and straighten your back. In addition, your shoulder posture often appears a bit lopsided, which could be caused by uneven muscle strength or repetitive movements. While these scores indicate some room for improvement, the good news is that your neck posture has shown great improvement with a near-perfect score! To improve your overall posture, I recommend taking short breaks throughout the day to stretch and straighten your back, paying close attention to your seated posture and alternating sides while carrying heavy objects to help balance out your shoulder
