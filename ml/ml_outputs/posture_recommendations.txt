It seems like overall your back posture is good, but you may have a tendency to round your shoulders forward and overcurve your neck. Remember to keep your head straight and your shoulders back, as these habits can negatively impact your long-term health. Try to be more aware of your posture, especially while sitting and using technology. Incorporating regular stretching exercises for your back and keeping your shoulders aligned when standing or walking will also help improve your posture.
